"""Populates topic_edges for a subject the first time it's needed.

Two tiers, checked in order:
  1. CURATED_SEEDS — a small, hand-reviewed set of common subjects (source='seed').
  2. LLM generation — one Groq call producing a broad topic list + prerequisite
     edges for anything not curated (source='llm'), validated before insert.

Idempotent: seed_subject_graph() is a no-op if the subject already has edges,
so it's safe to call on every subject creation without re-seeding or
re-billing an LLM call for subjects other users already triggered.
